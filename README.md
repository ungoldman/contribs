A command line program that pipes [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) to [`stdout`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stdout). Contributions welcome!

## Install

```
npm i contribs -g
```

## Usage

```
contribs > CONTRIBUTING.md
```

The `contribs` command pipes the contents of the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in this repository to [`stdout`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_stdout). You can achieve the same effect as above by copying `CONTRIBUTING.md` into your project manually.
